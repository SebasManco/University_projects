# University Projects

## RQM_codes:
here are the projects corresponding to the relativistic quantum mechanics subject:  

 - **RQM_1.jl:** This corresponds to the solution of the Schrodinger equation for a porticle  inside a 3D box under a potential $U = U_0$. Made by the finite difference method.
